# Order-Gui
Java Food Order Gui

Object-Oriented Programming Assignment 5. Authors Mr. Brown and Dr. Yunis are cited, as they created the assignment and provided skeleton methods for me to fill out to make the GUI functional. 

It allows a user to select and print an order of food for the restaurant. 

All of my code is in the src forlder. 

The assignment can be imported into eclipse and should be able to run.
